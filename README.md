# Mean_Shift_Clustering
Meanshift is falling under the category of a clustering algorithm in contrast of Unsupervised learning that assigns the data points to the clusters iteratively by shifting points towards the mode (mode is the highest density of data points in the region, in the context of the Meanshift). As such, it is also known as the Mode-seeking algorithm. Mean-shift algorithm has applications in the field of image processing and computer vision.
